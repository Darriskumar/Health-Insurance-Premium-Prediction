Health insurance premium prediction involves leveraging data and statistical or machine learning models to estimate the cost of health insurance coverage for individuals or groups. Health insurance, which mitigates the financial risk of medical expenses, varies in cost from person to person. This process aims to calculate anticipated healthcare coverage expenses based on factors such as age, gender, health status, location, and more. By developing a machine learning-based approach, these techniques help insurance providers set fair and competitive premiums while ensuring that policyholders can make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage.
